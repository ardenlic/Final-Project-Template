My research question was to look at how dstorm-driven wave events impact coastal bathymetry, specifically morphological changes like erosion and accretion, compared to typical wave patterns. My goals were to see how coastline behavior differs in 2015 vs 2016 storm and during a La Nina vs. El Nino? There were the largest shoreline shift in June 2016, which disrupted the typical 8-10 year accretion-erosion cycle. The 2015 storm which had similiar wave height to the 2016 storm caused no change to the cycle and minor erosion, so it proves that storms that bring eastward waves (instead of the usual southeast direction) cause significant erosion on east-facing beaches like Narrabeen. This supports my hypothesis that atypical wave direction  significantly impacts erosion rates and recovery, particularly in areas with high sediment variability like Narrabeen.
